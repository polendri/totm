With the holidays we got a late start on this month, so Cam is going to hold
off until February before running a topic of his own (at least that's
currently the plan). I'm also too busy to put a lot content up this month,
but I figured I'd do a one-off to hold us over.

Without further ado, here's a mini-TotM on Vim.

## What is Vim?

Vim is a highly configurable, efficient, open-source, multi-platform text editor;
admittedly, it's a complex one too. It's been around since 1991, and it
builds on the functionality of the vi editor which dates back to 1976, so it's
been around for a very long time (embarrassingly, I only just barely predate it
myself).

Its effectiveness at editing comes from extensively using keyboard shortcuts,
to the point that the mouse essentially never needs to be used. This can
greatly improve the speed and comfort of editing text compared to more
traditional text editors, at the cost of imposing the memorization of said
shortcuts.

## Why it's worth a try

If you spend a lot of time doing something menial, I think you owe it to
yourself to dedicate time to making it easier for yourself to do that something
comfortably and effectively. As such, if you spend a lot of your time editing
text (when programming for example), you should spend some time customizing and
fine-tuning your text editor.

It only takes a half hour to follow a tutorial and try an editor like Vim, but
the potential benefits --- if you do end up finding it to your liking --- are
substantial.

## Why not Emacs?

No reason! I don't know it very well yet personally, whereas Vim I know well
enough to advocate it. [Here's](http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/986/what-are-the-pros-and-cons-of-vim-and-emacs)
a StackExchange thread discussing some of the differences between the two
editors if you're curious. Vim is my favourite, but it does not have to be
yours.

## Learning some Vim

The nice thing about Vim is that you really only need to know maybe a dozen
shortcuts in order to have a nearly complete set of editing capabilities; all
the other shortcuts just make things even quicker and can be learned at your
leisure. The following interactive tutorial will speed through all of these
basic commands:

Don't be discouraged if you find that went too quickly! Perhaps you might
instead prefer to learn some Vim basics via *video game*?

## Installing Vim, learning more

If you're at all interested in the features you were introduced too in those
interactive tutorials, I recommend you install Vim locally so you can fool
around with it in-depth. It's very easy to install, regardless of platform.

Full installation information for Vim is available on
[their website](http://www.vim.org/download.php).

### Windows

On Windows, the easiest thing to install is gVim, which is the GUI version
of Vim. It can be downloaded directly from the the vim.org servers [here](ftp://ftp.vim.org/pub/vim/pc/gvim74.exe).

### Linux

Vim is available under pretty much every linux distro's package manager, so it
can easily be installed using your distro's normal package installation
mechanism. In Ubuntu/Debian for example it can be installed on the command-line
using `sudo apt-get install vim` (or `sudo apt-get install vim-gnome` to
install the GUI version).

### Mac

There is a separate project called MacVim that integrates Vim nicely into the
Mac OS. Its homepage can be found [here](https://code.google.com/p/macvim/).

### Vim as a plugin

There are plugins for all kinds of other software that mimic Vim functionality
(to varying amounts of fidelity). For example:

* [VsVim for Visual Studio](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329)
* [Vrapper for Eclipse](http://vrapper.sourceforge.net/home/)
* [Vintage mode in Sublme Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/vintage.html)
  (technically this a vi mode that is part of Sublime Text itself)

### More tutorials

Vim comes packaged with an interactive tutorial of its own. If you have
command-line Vim installed, this tutorial can be started by running the
`vimtutor` command; for the GUI version, you need to open gVim and then
open the tutorial file located at `C:\Program Files\Vim\vim74\tutor\tutor`
(assuming the default install location).

Beyond that, there are dozens of great references and introductory tutorials
for Vim all over the Internet. A few examples:

* [http://blog.interlinked.org/tutorials/vim_tutorial.html](http://blog.interlinked.org/tutorials/vim_tutorial.html)
* [http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/228600-vim-101-a-beginners-guide-to-vim](http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/228600-vim-101-a-beginners-guide-to-vim)
* The following excellent cheat sheet:

## A few more advanced features

Knowing only the basics of navigating and editing text, it might still be hard
to imagine how Vim can be that much more efficient than "traditional" text
editing. As such, I figured I should share a couple fancier and really useful
examples of command combinations:

* **To word wrap text so as not to exceed a given column width:** Make a
  selection in visual mode and press `gq`; the text gets wrapped using the
  configured text width (default 80).
* **To copy and paste things from multiple buffers:** `"a` can be prepended to
  any yank or paste operation (e.g. `"ayy` to copy a line or `"ap` to paste) to
  copy or paste to the named buffer `a`. This goes for `"b`, `"c`, etc. It's
  great if you need to paste two or three different things throughout a
  document, since you can keep each one in a buffer instead of being stuck with
  a single clipboard buffer.
* **To auto-indent code:** Make a selection and press `=G` (or type `gg=G` to
  indent the entire document).

## Configuring Vim

Most Vim users customize the crap out of their editor, and for the most part
this is done in the `.vimrc` file which resides in your home directory (in
Windows it's `_vimrc`). It doesn't exist by default, so you may have to create
one.

[Here's a very detailed .vimrc that someone makes publicly available](http://amix.dk/vim/vimrc.html).
If you don't have a .vimrc of your own, it's worth dropping that one in and
running Vim again to see just how much of a difference it makes. It's also
fairly well documented so it can give you a good sense of what can be
configured (and the [Vim options documentation](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/options.html)
is a complete reference if you need any clarification).

It's usually pretty safe to assume that if you want Vim to do something, you
can make it behave that way with the right .vimrc settings. Want line numbers?
That's `set number`. Want tabs to look two spaces wide? `set tabstop=2`. Want
Vim to auto-indent as you type code? `set autoindent` and `set smartindent`.

## Final remarks

If you've slogged all the way through to the end of this post, I hope that if
nothing else you found it interesting to learn about Vim. I admit, I looove
this editor, and I go out of my way to find and install Vim plugins (or
Vim-like plugins) whenever I have to use another tool to do a lot of editing.

It's not an easy thing to pick up compared to simpler text editors, but if
you're writing text for hours a day, you can save yourself a ton of time by
sinking some time into learning shortcuts. An hour to get started, and a few
minutes a week learning a new thing or two -- that's really all it takes.

Happy editing!
