Technology of the Month is a website that picks a new software development
technology every month and aims to teach the basics with tutorials and
exercises. The idea is that exposure to the wide variety of languages,
frameworks, engines, and tools makes us better software developers :).

All the content is on the gh-pages branch, so you probably want to head on over
there.
